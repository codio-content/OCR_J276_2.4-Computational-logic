The following statement **P = NOT(A AND B)** can be represented by a logic diagram.

The NOT gate will reverse the output from the AND gate.

If the output from the AND gate is 0 at C then it will be 1 at P and vice versa.

The following statement **P = NOT(A OR B)** can be represented by a logic diagram.

If there is an input at either A or B or both of them, then there is no output at P as in a 'NOT' gate an output of 1 is produced if there is an input of 0 and vice versa.
