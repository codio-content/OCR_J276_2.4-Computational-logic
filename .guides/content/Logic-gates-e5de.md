We can use our brains to work out the results of logical operations and use truth tables for assistance.  
The processors in computers, however, have to rely on transistors wired together to form logic gates.
Each logic gate has one or more inputs and an output. An electric current that is output represents the binary digit 1(or true) and a low or no current at all represents 0 (or false).

In a NOT gate there is an output only if there is **no** input and no output if there is an input.

The logic gates can be combined into logic circuits and represented in logic diagrams.
