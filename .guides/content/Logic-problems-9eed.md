Program code presents the computer with logic problems.
For example the line of code:

```if length > 10 AND width > 6 then```

presents the computer with a logic problem as the statements can be evaluated as either TRUE or False.

If the condition for length (> 10) AND the condition for width (>6) are both TRUE then the overall statement is also TRUE.

But if either of them is false then so is the overall statement.

It can be evaluated using a truth table:

The code

```if length > 10 OR width > 6 then```

could be evaluated in the following truth table:

![](.guides/img/truth2.png)

Only one as well as both of the conditions has to be TRUE to make the overall statement TRUE.
