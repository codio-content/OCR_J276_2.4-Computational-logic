Computers operate as digital devices using transistors which are either on or off.

The transistors either transmit an electric current (on) or they do not (off).

These two states of on or off can be used to represent the two conditions of **true** (on) or **false** (off).

The two states are also represented by the digits 1 and 0.
(This is also explained in section 2.6 - Data Representation)

As there are two states, true and false, computers are ideal for solving logic problems. Boolean logic is a form of algebra, invented by George Boole, in which all values are reduced to one of two states, TRUE or FALSE.
